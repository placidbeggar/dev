                    Since 2015, a little roaster-cafe hybrid called Abracadabra has been fueling the Woodstock
                    community with magical coffee. Too often, brands hide behind good marketing and branding without
                    paying enough attention to the actual stuff they're selling â€” but not Abracadabra.
